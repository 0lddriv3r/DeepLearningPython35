# Overview

### neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com integrated scripts for Python 3.4.3 and Theano with CUDA support

These scrips are updated ones from the **neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com** gitHub repository in order to fully work with Python 3.4.3.

The testing file (**test.py**) contains all three networks (network.py, network2.py, network3.py) and is the starting point to run (i.e. *train and evaluate*) them.

# Usage

Just type at shell:
**python3 test.py**

# Aim

I just want to make other's life easier. Feel free to modify it.
